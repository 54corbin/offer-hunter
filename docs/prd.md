### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type

*   [x] UI/UX Overhaul

#### Enhancement Description

The goal is to modernize the existing user interface to make it more visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly. This involves a significant redesign of the current UI components and layout.

#### Impact Assessment

*   [x] Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

*   Improve the overall visual appeal of the application.
*   Enhance the user experience (UX) to make it more intuitive.
*   Increase user engagement and satisfaction through a modern design.
*   Ensure the new UI is responsive and accessible.

#### Background Context

The current UI is functional but lacks modern design aesthetics. A UI/UX overhaul will bring the application up to modern standards, making it more competitive and enjoyable for users. This enhancement will focus on redesigning the visual elements and improving the overall user flow without changing the core functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional

*   **FR1:** All existing features must be fully accessible and functional within the new user interface.
*   **FR2:** The application's navigation must be redesigned to be more intuitive.
*   **FR3:** All forms for user input will be redesigned for improved usability and clarity.
*   **FR4:** Data displays will be redesigned to be more organized and visually engaging.

### Non-Functional

*   **NFR1:** The UI will adopt a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic based on Material Design principles.
*   **NFR2:** The application must be fully responsive.
*   **NFR3:** A consistent design system will be applied.
*   **NFR4:** All interactive elements must provide clear visual feedback.
*   **NFR5:** The UI will adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

### Compatibility Requirements

*   **CR1: API/Service Compatibility:** The new UI must integrate seamlessly with the existing services.
*   **CR2: Data Schema Compatibility:** The redesigned UI must not introduce any breaking changes to the data structures.
*   **CR3: UI/UX Consistency:** The new design will establish a clear visual identity.
*   **CR4: Routing Compatibility:** The existing routing structure will be preserved.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The new UI will be a complete replacement of the existing component styles, leveraging the existing component structure but replacing the styling with a new design system.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

*   Lock Screen
*   Main Application Layout
*   Dashboard/Home Page
*   Profiles Page
*   Job History Page
*   Settings Page

### UI Consistency Requirements

*   A new, modern color palette will be defined.
*   A clear and readable typography scale will be established.
*   A set of standardized, reusable components will be created.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

*   **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
*   **Frameworks**: React, Tailwind CSS
*   **Bundler**: Webpack

### Integration Approach

*   The UI will continue to interact with the existing services and data storage without changes.
*   The new UI will be built by replacing the styling of existing React components.

### Code Organization and Standards

*   We will adhere to the existing file structure and create a new `src/components/ui` directory for new, standardized components.
*   We will follow existing coding standards and naming conventions.

### Deployment and Operations

*   The existing Webpack build process and deployment strategy will be used.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

*   **Risks**: Visual regressions, inconsistencies, breaking data flow.
*   **Mitigation**: Develop a style guide, create reusable components, and conduct thorough manual testing.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

This enhancement will be structured as a single, comprehensive epic to ensure a consistent design vision.

## Epic 1: UI/UX Overhaul

**Epic Goal**: To completely redesign and modernize the user interface.

**Stories**:

1.  **Establish Design System & Base Components**: Create the foundational design system and core reusable UI components.
2.  **Redesign the Main App Layout & Navigation**: Implement the new main layout with intuitive navigation.
3.  **Redesign the Lock Screen & Dashboard**: Redesign the initial screen and the main dashboard.
4.  **Redesign the Profiles & Settings Pages**: Redesign the forms and layouts for managing profiles and settings.
5.  **Redesign the Job History Page**: Redesign the page for tracking job applications.

## Out of Scope

*   Changes to core functionality.
*   Backend or service changes.
*   Automated testing.
*   Major architectural changes.

## Open Questions

*   Are there any specific design inspirations or existing applications whose aesthetic you would like to emulate for the new UI?
*   Do you have any existing brand guidelines (e.g., logos, specific colors or fonts) that should be incorporated into the new design?
