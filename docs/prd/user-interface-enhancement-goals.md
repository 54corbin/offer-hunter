# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The new UI will be a complete replacement of the existing component styles, leveraging the existing component structure but replacing the styling with a new design system.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

*   Lock Screen
*   Main Application Layout
*   Dashboard/Home Page
*   Profiles Page
*   Job History Page
*   Settings Page

### UI Consistency Requirements

*   A new, modern color palette will be defined.
*   A clear and readable typography scale will be established.
*   A set of standardized, reusable components will be created.
