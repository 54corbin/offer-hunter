# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

*   **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
*   **Frameworks**: React, Tailwind CSS
*   **Bundler**: Webpack

### Integration Approach

*   The UI will continue to interact with the existing services and data storage without changes.
*   The new UI will be built by replacing the styling of existing React components.

### Code Organization and Standards

*   We will adhere to the existing file structure and create a new `src/components/ui` directory for new, standardized components.
*   We will follow existing coding standards and naming conventions.

### Deployment and Operations

*   The existing Webpack build process and deployment strategy will be used.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

*   **Risks**: Visual regressions, inconsistencies, breaking data flow.
*   **Mitigation**: Develop a style guide, create reusable components, and conduct thorough manual testing.
