# Epic 1: UI/UX Overhaul - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

To completely redesign and modernize the user interface of the Offer Hunter Chrome Extension, making it more visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly. This will improve the overall user experience and bring the application up to modern design standards.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

*   **Current relevant functionality**: The application currently allows users to manage profiles, track job applications, and generate content using an LLM. It features a passcode lock screen for security.
*   **Technology stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Webpack, and `react-router-dom`.
*   **Integration points**: The UI components interact with `storageService.ts` (for `chrome.storage`) and `llmService.ts`. The UI overhaul will not change these service integrations.

### Enhancement Details

*   **What's being added/changed**: This epic involves a complete visual redesign of all UI components and pages. A new, standardized component library will be built in `src/components/ui`, and all existing pages will be updated to use these new components.
*   **How it integrates**: The new components will replace the existing ones within the current React component structure. The application's routing and business logic will remain unchanged.
*   **Success criteria**:
    *   The final UI is visually consistent and adheres to a defined design system.
    *   All existing application features are fully functional and accessible through the new UI.
    *   The application is responsive and adheres to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

### Stories

1.  **Story 1.1: Establish Design System & Base Components**: Create the foundational design system (colors, typography, spacing) in Tailwind CSS and build the core reusable UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Modal`, `Header`, `Sidebar`).
2.  **Story 1.2: Redesign the Main App Layout & Navigation**: Implement the new main application layout, including the new `Sidebar` for navigation, ensuring all routes are correctly rendered.
3.  **Story 1.3: Redesign the Lock Screen & Home Page**: Apply the new design system to the `PasscodeComponent` and the main `HomePage`, ensuring they are visually appealing and functional.
4.  **Story 1.4: Redesign the Profile & Settings Pages**: Redesign the forms and layouts for managing user profiles and application settings using the new component library.
5.  **Story 1.5: Redesign the Job History & Other Pages**: Apply the new design to the remaining pages, including `HistoryPage`, `JobsPage`, and `PrivacyPolicyPage`.

### Compatibility Requirements

*   [x] Existing APIs (`storageService.ts`, `llmService.ts`) remain unchanged.
*   [x] Data schema for `UserProfile`, `Job`, and `Settings` in `chrome.storage` will not be altered.
*   [x] UI changes will establish a new, consistent design system.
*   [x] Performance will not be negatively impacted by the new UI components.

### Risk Mitigation

*   **Primary Risk**: Introducing visual regressions or breaking the data flow between components and services.
*   **Mitigation**: All new components will be tested manually across all pages. The separation of concerns between UI and services minimizes the risk to business logic.
*   **Rollback Plan**: The changes will be developed on a separate Git branch. In case of critical issues, the old branch can be redeployed.

### Definition of Done

*   [ ] All stories are completed, and their acceptance criteria are met.
*   [ ] All existing functionality has been manually tested and verified to work correctly with the new UI.
*   [ ] The new UI is consistent across all pages and responsive.
*   [ ] The `prd.md` and `architecture.md` documents are updated to reflect the new UI components and design system.
