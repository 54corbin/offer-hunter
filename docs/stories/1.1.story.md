# Story 1.1: Establish Design System & Base Components

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish a foundational design system and create a core set of reusable UI components,
**so that** all subsequent UI development is consistent, efficient, and adheres to a modern aesthetic.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new `src/components/ui` directory is created to house the new, generic UI components.
2. A new `tailwind.config.js` is configured with a modern color palette (primary blue, grays), typography scale, and spacing units.
3. The following core UI components are created in `src/components/ui`: `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Header`, `Sidebar`.
4. These components are fully styled with Tailwind CSS and provide clear visual feedback for all states (hover, focus, active, disabled).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1):** Create the `src/components/ui` directory.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 2):** Update `tailwind.config.js` with the new design system tokens.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Define a modern color palette with a primary blue and neutral grays.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Define a typography scale for headings and body text.
    - [x] Subtask 2.3: Define a consistent spacing unit scale.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 3, 4):** Create the core UI components.
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create `Button.tsx` with variants for primary, secondary, and destructive actions.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create `Input.tsx` with styles for default, focus, and error states.
    - [x] Subtask 3.3: Create `Card.tsx` as a flexible container for content.
    - [x] Subtask 3.4: Create `Modal.tsx` for displaying dialogs and pop-ups.
    - [x] Subtask 3.5: Create `Header.tsx` as the top-level header component.
    - [x] Subtask 3.6: Create `Sidebar.tsx` for the main navigation.
- [x] **Task 4:** Create a simple storybook or documentation page to display the new components and their states.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   New components will be located in `extension_webpack/src/components/ui/`.
*   The `tailwind.config.js` to be modified is at `extension_webpack/tailwind.config.js`.
*   [Source: docs/architecture.md#Enhancement Impact Areas (UI/UX Overhaul)]

### Component Specifications
*   Components should be built with reusability in mind, accepting props for content and configuration.
*   Components must provide clear visual feedback for all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled).
*   [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-ui-ux-overhaul.md#Stories]

### Technical Constraints
*   All components must be styled using Tailwind CSS.
*   The new components must not introduce breaking changes to the existing application structure.
*   [Source: docs/architecture.md#Technical Debt and Known Issues]

### Testing
*   As per the architecture document, there is no automated testing framework. All components must be manually tested to ensure they render correctly and all states are visually represented as expected.
