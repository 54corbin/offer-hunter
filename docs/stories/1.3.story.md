# Story 1.3: Redesign the Lock Screen & Dashboard

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a visually appealing and straightforward lock screen and dashboard,
**so that** my first impression of the app is positive and I can quickly see the status of my job hunting.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `LockScreen` component is redesigned using the new `Card`, `Input`, and `Button` components.
2. The `Dashboard` page (`HomePage.tsx`) is redesigned with a clean layout, using `Card` components to display key information.
3. The visual design of both pages aligns with the new design system.
4. The passcode entry and validation logic on the `LockScreen` remains fully functional.
5. The data displayed on the `Dashboard` is correctly fetched and rendered from the `storageService`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 4):** Redesign the `PasscodeComponent`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Refactor `extension_webpack/src/components/passcode/PasscodeComponent.tsx` to use the new `Card`, `Input`, and `Button` components.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Apply the new design system styles for a clean and modern look.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Verify that the passcode submission and validation logic is preserved and fully functional.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 2, 3, 5):** Redesign the `HomePage` (Dashboard).
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Refactor `extension_webpack/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` to remove all old, hardcoded layout and styling.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Rebuild the page layout using the new `Card` component as the primary container for content.
    - [x] Subtask 2.3: Replace the old button and modal with the new `Button` and `Modal` components from the UI library.
    - [x] Subtask 2.4: Ensure all data fetching and display logic remains intact and functional.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
*   Story 1.2 successfully established the main application layout with the new `Sidebar` and `Header`. This story will build on that by redesigning the content of the first two primary views: the lock screen and the dashboard.
*   The `HomePage.tsx` was partially refactored in a previous step to fix a layout issue. This story will complete that refactoring.

### File Locations

*   `extension_webpack/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
*   [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree and Module Organization]

### Component Specifications
*   Use the `Card` component to create a clean, contained look for both the lock screen form and the dashboard content.
*   Use the `Input` component for the passcode field.
*   Use the `Button` component for the "Unlock" and "Generate Cover Letter" buttons.
*   Use the `Modal` component for the generated cover letter display.

### Technical Constraints
*   Do not modify the existing logic for passcode validation in `App.tsx` or the data fetching in `HomePage.tsx`. This story is focused on the view layer.
*   Ensure the redesigned components are responsive and work well within the established layout.

### Testing
*   Manually test the lock screen by entering both correct and incorrect passcodes.
*   Manually test the "Generate Cover Letter" functionality on the dashboard to ensure the modal works correctly.
*   Verify that the dashboard content is displayed correctly.
