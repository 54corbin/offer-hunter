# Story 1.2: Redesign the Main App Layout & Navigation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a redesigned main application layout with clear, intuitive navigation,
**so that** I can easily access all features of the extension.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main `App.tsx` component is updated to use a modern layout structure (e.g., a sidebar for navigation and a main content area).
2. The primary navigation is redesigned using the new `Sidebar` component, with clear icons and labels for Dashboard, Profiles, Job History, and Settings.
3. The top-level `Header` component is redesigned to be clean and modern, displaying the current page title.
4. The routing logic in `App.tsx` remains unchanged, correctly rendering the page components in the main content area.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2):** Update `Layout.tsx` to use the new `Sidebar` component.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Import the `Sidebar` component from `src/components/ui/Sidebar.tsx`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Replace the old `Nav` component with the new `Sidebar`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Ensure the main content area is correctly positioned next to the sidebar.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 3):** Integrate the new `Header` component.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add the `Header` component to the main content area of `Layout.tsx`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement a mechanism to update the header title based on the current route.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 4):** Verify routing and layout.
    - [x] Subtask 3.1: Manually test all navigation links in the sidebar to ensure they route to the correct pages.
    - [x] Subtask 3.2: Confirm that the main layout is responsive and displays correctly at different window sizes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
*   Story 1.1 established the core UI components, including `Sidebar` and `Header`, which are ready for integration.
*   The QA review for Story 1.1 refactored the `Sidebar` to accept navigation items as a prop, which should be utilized in this story.

### File Locations
*   The primary files to be modified are `extension_webpack/src/components/Layout.tsx` and `extension_webpack/src/App.tsx`.
*   The components to be integrated are located in `extension_webpack/src/components/ui/`.
*   [Source: docs/architecture.md#Enhancement Impact Areas (UI/UX Overhaul)]

### Component Specifications
*   The `Layout.tsx` component should be the main container for the `Sidebar` and the page content.
*   The `Sidebar` component should be passed an array of `NavigationItem` objects.
*   The `Header` component should receive the current page title as a prop.
*   [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#QA Results]

### Technical Constraints
*   The existing routing logic in `App.tsx` must not be altered.
*   The new layout must be implemented using Tailwind CSS and the components from the new design system.
*   [Source: docs/architecture.md#Integration Considerations]

### Testing
*   Manual testing is required to verify all acceptance criteria.
*   Test all navigation links to ensure they work as expected.
*   Verify that the layout is responsive.
