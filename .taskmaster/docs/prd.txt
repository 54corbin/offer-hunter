# 1. Introduction

**Project Name:** Offer Hunter

This document outlines the requirements for a Google Chrome extension designed to streamline and automate the job application process using Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal of "Offer Hunter" is to save users significant time and enhance the quality and relevance of their job applications. It achieves this by allowing users to upload their resumes, receive AI-driven job recommendations, and leverage AI-powered features to automatically fill application forms and generate tailored answers to application questions on popular job platforms.

# 2. Problem Statement

The modern job search is often a high-volume, repetitive, and time-consuming process. Job seekers spend countless hours searching for suitable roles, manually entering the same information into numerous application forms, and tailoring cover letters and answers for each specific position. This tedious process can lead to burnout and a lower quality of applications, reducing the chances of securing an interview. There is a need for a tool that can intelligently automate these repetitive tasks, allowing the user to focus on the strategic aspects of their job search.
