### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation & Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd offer_hunter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project's dependencies are located in the `extension_webpack` directory.
    ```bash
    cd extension_webpack
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the extension:**
    To build the extension, run the following command from within the `extension_webpack` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will compile the source code and package it into the `extension_webpack/dist` directory.

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
3.  Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button.
4.  Select the `extension_webpack/dist` directory from the project folder.
5.  The Offer Hunter extension should now be loaded and visible in your browser's toolbar.

## Configuration

Before you can use the AI-powered features, you need to configure an AI provider in the extension's settings page.

1.  Click on the Offer Hunter icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** page.

### OpenAI / Gemini

1.  Click **"Add Provider"**.
2.  Select "OpenAI" or "Gemini" from the dropdown.
3.  Enter your API key.
4.  Select a model from the list.
5.  Click **"Set as Active"**.

### Ollama (for local models)

1.  Click **"Add Provider"**.
2.  Select "Ollama" from the dropdown.
3.  The host URL will default to `http://localhost:11434`. Adjust it if your Ollama server runs on a different address.
4.  Click the refresh icon next to the model dropdown to fetch the list of your locally available models.
5.  Select a model.
6.  Click **"Set as Active"**.

**Important:** For Ollama to work, you need to configure it to allow requests from the extension. Start your Ollama server with the `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable set to allow the extension's origin.

```bash
# Allow any Chrome extension (easiest for development)
OLLAMA_ORIGINS='chrome-extension://*' ollama serve
```
