- [x] 2.2 Implement modern design patterns (glassmorphism/neumorphism elements)
- [x] 2.3 Add variant support (size, style, state variants)
- [x] 2.4 Enhance icon system with morphing capabilities

## 3. Animation Implementation
- [x] 3.1 Create smooth progress fill animation with easing curves
- [x] 3.2 Implement hover/press state transitions
- [x] 3.3 Add loading and completion state animations
- [x] 3.4 Create icon animation system (square to X morphing)
- [x] 3.5 Add pulse/attention-getting animations for certain states

## 4. Accessibility Enhancement
- [x] 4.1 Add proper ARIA labels and states
- [x] 4.2 Implement keyboard navigation support
- [x] 4.3 Add reduced motion media query support
- [x] 4.4 Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
- [x] 4.5 Add focus indicators for keyboard users

## 5. Performance Optimization
- [x] 5.1 Use CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- [x] 5.2 Implement will-change properties for animated elements
- [x] 5.3 Optimize animation timing to maintain 60fps
- [x] 5.4 Add animation performance monitoring

## 6. Testing & Validation
- [x] 6.1 Test animations across different browsers
- [x] 6.2 Verify accessibility with screen readers
- [x] 6.3 Test reduced motion preferences
- [x] 6.4 Performance testing with animation inspector
- [x] 6.5 Cross-device testing (desktop, mobile)

## 7. Documentation & Examples
- [x] 7.1 Add component documentation with props table
- [x] 7.2 Create usage examples for different states
- [x] 7.3 Document animation customization options
- [x] 7.4 Add accessibility guidelines

## 8. Final Validation
- [x] 8.1 Compile and type-check the component
