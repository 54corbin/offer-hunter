## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Progress Button Component
The ProgressButton component SHALL provide a modern, animated interface for displaying and controlling progress-related actions with enhanced visual feedback and accessibility features.

#### Scenario: Idle state display
- **WHEN** component renders with progress between 0-100 and not loading
- **THEN** display modern button design with smooth gradients, proper typography, and hover animations

#### Scenario: Progress tracking display
- **WHEN** progress value updates from 0 to 100
- **THEN** smoothly animate progress fill using hardware-accelerated CSS transforms with easing curves

#### Scenario: Interactive hover states
- **WHEN** user hovers over button in idle or loading states
- **THEN** trigger smooth scale transformation (1.02x) and enhanced shadow elevation

#### Scenario: Active/pressed state
- **WHEN** user presses down on button (mouse down or keyboard activation)
- **THEN** animate scale transformation to 0.98x with subtle color saturation increase

#### Scenario: Loading state animation
- **WHEN** component enters loading state
- **THEN** display pulsing animation on progress fill and optional spinner overlay

#### Scenario: Completion state
- **WHEN** progress reaches 100% and action completes
- **THEN** trigger success animation with color transition to green spectrum and checkmark appearance

#### Scenario: Icon state transitions
- **WHEN** button state changes between stop, loading, and complete
- **THEN** smoothly morph icons using CSS transforms without layout shifts

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Enhanced TypeScript Interfaces
The component SHALL provide comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all props and state management.

#### Scenario: Props interface validation
- **WHEN** component receives props through TypeScript interface
- **THEN** validate all required and optional props with proper type checking

### Requirement: Accessibility Features
The component SHALL support comprehensive accessibility including keyboard navigation, screen readers, and reduced motion preferences.

#### Scenario: Keyboard navigation
- **WHEN** user tabs to button using keyboard
- **THEN** show visible focus indicator with sufficient contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)

#### Scenario: Screen reader support
- **WHEN** assistive technology reads the component
- **THEN** provide descriptive ARIA labels including current progress percentage and action description

#### Scenario: Reduced motion preference
- **WHEN** user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled
- **THEN** disable or significantly reduce animation durations while maintaining functionality

### Requirement: Animation Performance Standards
The component SHALL maintain 60fps animations using hardware acceleration and optimized rendering.

#### Scenario: Smooth animation performance
- **WHEN** animations are running
- **THEN** maintain consistent 60fps using CSS transforms and opacity for GPU acceleration

#### Scenario: Memory efficient animations
- **WHEN** animations are active
- **THEN** use will-change property strategically to avoid memory leaks and excessive GPU usage

### Requirement: Variant System
The component SHALL support multiple visual variants for different use cases and design contexts.

#### Scenario: Size variant selection
- **WHEN** size prop is set to small, medium, or large
- **THEN** adjust padding, font-size, and icon dimensions proportionally

#### Scenario: Style variant application
- **WHEN** style variant (primary, secondary, danger) is selected
- **THEN** apply appropriate color schemes and visual treatments
