## Why
The current ProgressButton.tsx component has basic styling and simple gradient animations that feel outdated. Users expect modern, smooth, and engaging UI interactions, especially in productivity tools like Offer Hunter where the button represents important stop/cancel functionality during job application automation.

The existing component lacks visual hierarchy, modern design patterns, and doesn't provide clear visual feedback about the action being performed. A modern, animated ProgressButton will improve user experience and make the extension feel more polished and professional.

## What Changes
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Implement modern design patterns with improved typography, spacing, and color schemes
- **Smooth Animations**: Add sophisticated micro-interactions including:
  - Progress fill animations with easing curves
  - Button hover/press state transitions
  - Loading and completion state animations
  - Icon morphing animations
- **Improved Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels, focus states, and reduced motion support
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced type safety with additional interfaces and optional props
- **Performance Optimization**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for hardware-accelerated animations
- **Variants & States**: Support for different visual states (idle, loading, completed, error)

## Impact
- Affected specs: UI Component Specifications
- Affected code: `extension_webpack/src/components/ProgressButton.tsx`
- Breaking changes: None (backward compatible API)
- Performance impact: Minimal - uses CSS animations for smooth 60fps performance
- Accessibility improvement: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support
